# CricketSimulation
Simulatation the last 4 overs of the match. It's the last 4 overs of the match. Bengaluru needs 40 runs to win and with 4 wickets left. Each
player has a different probability for scoring runs. Your coding problem is to simulate the match,
ball by ball. The match simulation will require you to use a weighted random number generation
based on probability to determine the runs scored per ball.
